Gotcha expands on the game's Line Of Sight indicator, adding the ability to anticipate if a move will flank an enemy, if they are visible through squadsight, and when certain mission objectives will be in view.


==Latest Update== 
-Name change! We're expanding the mod's features, so now Flank Preview is called Gotcha. (Don't worry, internally it's still called Flank Preview. Your saved games are safe.)

-New feature: Squadsight! When moving a soldier with the squadsight ability (eg: Sharpshooters), if an enemy is outside of their normal vision you will instead see two new icons which indicate either line of sight (red diamond) or a flanking position (yellow half-diamond).

-New feature: Destructible Objective Indicator! The location arrow for destructible objectives (eg: Alien Transmitter) will now change when previewing a move that puts it in sight. It does not have it's own art for squadsight (yet), so the diamond indicators will be an interim solution.

-Bugfixes & optimization of the existing flanking algorithm.


==Upcoming Features== 
-Now that we know how to manipulate the objective arrows, we hope to offer indicators for when hackable mission objectives are in range and sight of a Specialist.


==Compatability=== 
-This mod overrides the class UIUnitFlagManager, and so will conflict with any other mod that overrides the same class.


==Thanks==
