This mod adds the ability to preview if a move will flank an enemy, as indicated by a yellow line of sight icon. 


==Latest Update== 
-New co-author! 
-New in game icon (begone, old ugly diamond thing!) 


==Known Issues== 
-This mod will occasionally give false positives, where the icon will change to yellow even though that position does not have a flank on the target: 
-----Directly adjacent to a target, on the inside of a half-cover corner 
-----Any position which is itself flanked by the target, and one tile away from a flank itself (a "backwards" peek) 
-----Melee only units (Berserkers, Psi Zombies, etc) will show flanking icons even though melee attacks do not benefit from flanking 
-Minor UI lag in extremely dense target environments. 


==Todo== 
-(Hopefully) Some function optimization 
-Sanity checking and corner case fixing 
-Solve world hunger, cure common cold, enslave humanity for nefarious purposes 


==Compatability=== 
-This mod overrides the class UIUnitFlagManager and UIUnitFlag, and so will conflict with any other mod that overrides the same classes.


Feedback is always appreciated, particularly when hunting down pesky false positives!
